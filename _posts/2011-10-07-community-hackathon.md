The Thamizha community is organising its first hackathon, to bring together software developers interested in creating free tamil software. The hackthon will take place in two parts of the world in parallel: Australia and Chennai, India. The Australia event is organised by the community members who live in different parts of the country. The Chennai event is supported by the ILUG-C (Indian Linux Users Group - Chennai), who also helped organise the event, along with the Thamizha community.
